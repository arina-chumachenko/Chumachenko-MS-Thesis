Abstract
========
While recent text-to-image personalization methods achieve high-fidelity concept generation, maintaining optimal balance between identity preservation and prompt adherence remains an unresolved challenge. 
This work advances Context Regularization (CoRe) method by introducing gram-based regularization to improve pose diversity and generation flexibility in synthesized images. 
A two-stage training strategy incorporating losses from a non-finetuned U-Net enhances generalization capabilities, while knowledge distillation optimizes attention map regularization, mitigating overfitting and artifacts. 
Experimental results demonstrate that these contributions collectively improve concept fidelity and textual alignment, enabling more robust and adaptable personalized image generation within diffusion-based frameworks.
